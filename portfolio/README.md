# Homework Assignment for Week 2 (Bootstrap)
# Product: Doug Davidoff Portfolio

### Location and Installation
Deployed website found here:
[https://dougdavidoff.github.io/week2-homework/portfolio/index.html](https://dougdavidoff.github.io/week2-homework/portfolio/index.html). The website requires no installation steps from the user.

### Purpose of the Project
Here we present *the initial stage of creating a professional-grade portfolio* for our work in coding bootcamp. This will be a great assistance as we prepare for the job search following graduation from bootcamp. The portfolio makes extensive use of Bootstrap, including its built-in formatting and grid layout technologies.

### Development Aids
*Development of the website* was greatly aided by coding samples found at the StartBootstrap and ReusableForms website. Specifically:
1. The page layout and the navbar were assisted from this StartBootstrap site:
[https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/full-image-background/](https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/full-image-background/)
1. The sticky Bootstrap foooter was created using this StartBootstrap site:
[https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/sticky-footer-flexbox/](https://startbootstrap.com/snippets/sticky-footer-flexbox/)
1. The email contact form was adapted from ReusableForms at:
[http://reusableforms.com/d/e1/bootstrap-contact-form-send-email](http://reusableforms.com/d/e1/bootstrap-contact-form-send-email)
1. Please note: ReusableForms provided PHP code and more technology allowing the developer to upload a complete form-handling product to the host. After discussing this with teaching staff, I elected to present just the form absent the handling technology. Clicking on "send" actually does nothing. I would like to add form-handling the the site later on.

**Project accomplishments:**
1. *Appearance* roughly matches examples supplied in the homework assignment.
1. A functioning *navigation bar* is presented. It is *consistent on all pages*. The navbar supplies links to index.html -- which is the About page -- as well as to portfolio.html and contact.html.
1. *Bootstrap's grid system* is used on portfolio.html and on contact.html. (NOTE: I did not use nesting rows in columns, which was a bonus challenge. Frankly, my layout did not offer an opportunity to make use of nesting rows in columns.)
1. The three-page website is *deployed*.
1. A *README* is supplied.
1. *All links work with one exception*. As discussed above, the "send" link on the email form has not been enabled.
1. *Semantic HTML* is employed.
1. Appropriate *personalized information* is built into the site.
1. *Bootstrap components and grid system* are used throughout the site.
1. A *sticky footer* is used, stemming from Bootstrap. This is one of the two *bonus challenges* in the homework assignment.
1. The website is responsive to different media/viewport sizes.
1. The website's three HTML pages were checked at W3.org's code validator.

**Project challenges**
Developing the website presented a number of challenges requiring help from the teaching staff and my tutor. Here is a list of challenges and their disposition:
1. Responsive layout and responsive images. After research and further study at W3schools.com and FreeCodeCamp.org, I was able to work things out, more or less. This task included use of minimal media queries and presentation on the "xs" and "sm" screens. I learned that next time, I should begin coding in the mobile view and work to enlarge outwards.
1. When presented with a hamburger logo, the navbar did not work. I was able to resolve this.
1. I had to learn Markdown Language to format this README file.

**Tests**
Pages in this website were tested at the W3C Markup Validation Service found at:
