        <p class="lead">Doug Davidoff has been a newspaper reporter and a public relations consultant for private business, state government, and statewide political campaigns. He delights in blogging, social media, history, and writing. He also delights in software coding.</p>

        <p class="lead">But before all that (and of "all that," there was a great amount over the years), Doug was interested in computers and coding.</p>
            
        <p class="lead">During junior high school in the 1970s, Doug worked on a teletypewriter terminal connected by an acoustic telephone coupler to the school district's mainframe computer. He learned to play in BASIC and FORTRAN. During college, he worked with 80-column computer punch cards in the days when students submitted decks of cards in a refridgerator-sized reader machine and then waited hours for the output to arrive on big printout forms.</p>
            
        <p class="lead">Doug was recruited to become a computer science major. Instead he became a history major. Thus, a career direction was formed.</p>
            
        <p class="lead">Coding bootcamp is an opportunity to redirect that trajectory. So, Doug is a wordsmith who is training to become a codesmith.</p>
